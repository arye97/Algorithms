# Algorithms
The algorithms I wrote during my time in COSC262 at University of Canterbury
In these I have used Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth first search (bfs) and Floyds Algorithm to find the shortest distance between nodes. Also a greedy implementation of the coin change problem. Two implementations of the longest common substring problem, one recursive and one using dynamic programming. As well as an implementation of Radix Sort using Counting Sort.

All solutions have test cases, feel free to generate your own.
